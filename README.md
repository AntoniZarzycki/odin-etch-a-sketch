# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a part of [The Odin Project course](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## TODO

- Progressive darkening effect

## Limitations

- Site is not mobile-responsive (course didn't cover that yet)
- I've opted to use grid instead of flexbox for canvas. Project specifications said to not use grid for the canvas. However, using flexbox lead to overflow problems in some cases. I've searched through other project solutions, and people are either using grids or ending up with similar problems.
